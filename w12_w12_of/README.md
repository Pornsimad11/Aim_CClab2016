## Concept

I'm experimenting on computer vision to create mysterious visuals.  

## What I did 

I used Kyle Mcdonald's computer vision examples from https://github.com/kylemcdonald/ofxCv. Exploring 'example flow', 'example-difference-columns',' example-contours-basic' and combining the codes together, I was able to attain the mysterious visuals.
