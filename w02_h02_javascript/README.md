## Concept

Halloween is near and I still don't know what to wear was my inspiration for this project so I want to create a system that can pick a costume for me wear.  

## What I did 

I want to create a fun website so I illustrated my interface on illustrator. I coded the html and css and made the ghost animate. I manipulated the javascript code I learnt in class to help randomize the costumes on mouse clicked. 

## How can I develop this 

My goal for this website is to add API from amazon to be implemented into the websie. So when I click pick it will bring out halloween costumes from amazon and links me to buy it there right away. Moreover I want to add more animation to the website such as make the bats move and the spider move when my mous is over the side of the div. 

## Credits 

Codes from the week 2 class and the css animation I got inspired by the bounce.js library that I wanted to implement and in the process of learning how to do it.

## What did I learn
I became more familiar with the codes we have learn't in class became more used to creating variables and arrays and really taking the time to understand how it works. This made me more confident in using javascript and trying to read it.
