## Concept

I'm experimenting on how to create simple visuals movements on openframeworks  

## What I did 

I manipulated the code we did in class where when click, circle expands and move across the window by adding random colors to the circle, with the background un-updating all the time the continuous circle creates tunnel looking like forms. For the second project I found a basic line drawing tutorial (https://github.com/openframeworks/ofBook/blob/master/chapters/intro_to_graphics/chapter.md), I added random colors to the dot on the lines to make it look like there is energy flowing in the structure and also added key press to clear the drawing.

## What did I learn

I learnt how openframeworks work, how to generate a project, create circle, randomize colors and I need to understand more of the logic behind how animating each elements in the project work.
