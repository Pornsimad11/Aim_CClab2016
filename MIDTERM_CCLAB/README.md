## Concept

I am studying on the reasons patients are non compliant to their prescribed medicine in order to find a solution to help organize their medicine taking routine. 

More concept and development in the 'CCLAB MIDTERM PRESENTATION SLIDE'

## What I did 

According to the precedents, I want to improve user experience in creating an easy to use interface that will help them manage their medicine routine easier which will link to program the arduino to light up accordingly. 

I designed 'ALARMED' interfaces as prototypes for users to come and put in their data of the medicine they have to take. For the arduino I used the time alarm library and neopixel library to program and example daily cycle of a medicine. I tried to incoporate the sensor to the code that I have done and I wasn't able to. I tried using the for loop and switch but it wouldn't work so I left it out and create a video to demonstrate how it would actually work.

## What did I learn

I learnt how to use neopixel and how to put in time to trigger actions.
