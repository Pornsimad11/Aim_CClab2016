## Concept

I'm experimenting with the manipulation of the particle system to create an underwater environment filled with jellyfishes. 

## What I did 

I manipulated the particle system by randomizing between the color aqua and purple, make it rotate and make the circle size when fish click larger. I learn how to randomize the color in betweens by https://github.com/openframeworks/ofBook/blob/master/chapters/intro_to_graphics/chapter.md.

## What did I learn

I learnt how to refer to the classes in different files and how randomizing colors work.
