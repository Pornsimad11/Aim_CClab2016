## Concept

The Survival of the Baby Iguana 

I was inspired by the Iguana vs Snakes - Planet Earth II clip(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rv9hn4IGofM) in how the iguana has strive to survive. It reminded me to push forward in my finals week and so I want to dedicate the game to it.

## What I did 

I created my assets and followed Jesse Freeman 2D platformer game tutorial for the main parts of the game. I created the infinite scrolling background, put in the sounds, and designed the game so that the snake will atttack more violently like the real clip. 

## Credits 

My game is based on 

Unity 5 2D Essential Training (2015) by Jesse Freeman

## What did I learn

I learned the basic aspect of how to create a game on unity, how to create a spawner, and how to manage the game.
