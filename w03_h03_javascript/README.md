## Concept

Continuing on my previous topic on halloween, I want to create a fun interactive scream moments to hype people up for the coming day. 

## What I did 

I created a button for people to click and randomize scream moments from giphy sticker api. I continued on the code that I've learn in my elective and searched how to randomize giphy code from codepen.

## What did I learn 

From my elective I was unable to randomize giphy's api so I found another way to call the datas by codepen and try to get myself familiar with how it's done. I got more used to how functions work.
