## Concept

I'm experimenting on how to interact list of lines with movements to create visual illusions.

## What I did 

I created a list of colors and rotate each line of colors individually when mouse goes over

## Credits 

I was having problems to animate a rotation on the line so I learnt how to it by: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9441256/how-do-i-rotate-an-element-to-180-deg-over-150-ms-on-hover

## What did I learn
To create animations via css and trigger it with javascript
