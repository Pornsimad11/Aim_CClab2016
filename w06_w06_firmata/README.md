## Concept

Create different patterns by the control of lights  

## What I did 

https://youtu.be/vUI9JFSDjmM

I connected the photoresistor to arduino and uploaded the Standard Firmata. Then I ran the arduino input file processing gave and see how the photoresister was controling the analog circles. After that I manipulated the code by combining and changing some parts of the 'Radial Orbit' file (I got during bootcamp) in order to see how the photoresistor can create different patterns using those elements.  

## What did I learn 

I learnt how arduino can be used to control processing and through experimentation, I learnt how to manipulate the shapes with the code processing gave.
