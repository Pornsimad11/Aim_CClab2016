## Concept

Touch to light up 

## What I did 

Since the force sensor has two legs, one leg goes to 5V and for the other leg I have to share with an analog and a ground through a resistor so I soldered them together.

## What did I learn 

I learned how to use the multimeter, how to solder wires and how to connect the circuit without the breadboard.
